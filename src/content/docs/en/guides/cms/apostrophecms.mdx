[ApostropheCMS](https://apostrophecms.com) is an open-source JavaScript and NodeJS CMS that
supports editing directly on the page within an Astro application.

## Integrating with Astro

In this guide, you will use the [ApostropheCMS integration](https://apostrophecms.com/extensions/astro-integration)
to connect ApostropheCMS to Astro.

## Prerequisites

The following items are required to get started:

* **An Astro project.** Fork our [astro-frontend](https://github.com/apostrophecms/astro-frontend) project
as a starting point.

* **An ApostropheCMS project.** Fork our [starter-kit-astro](https://github.com/apostrophecms/starter-kit-astro) project
as a starting point.

* **Node.JS and npm,** as required by both Astro and ApostropheCMS.

* **A MongoDB database,** as required by ApostropheCMS. Use a [MongoDB Atlas free tier database](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=search_gs_pl_evergreen_atlas_core-high-int_prosp-brand_gic-null_amers-us_ps-all_desktop_eng_lead&utm_term=mongo%20atlas%20free%20tier&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=19609124046&adgroup=145188748043&cq_cmp=19609124046&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAs6-sBhBmEiwA1Nl8s1mNY6W2UqlY7GkWVr8GEc0ThfZlJvfGOkLpcFuC-TWXP3QowWM-DhoCF9YQAvD_BwE).

## Setting up the `astro-frontend` project

[astro-frontend](https://github.com/apostrophecms/astro-frontend) is an 
example of an Astro project that is already set up to use ApostropheCMS as its content source.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/apostrophecms/astro-frontend
cd astro-frontend
npm install
export APOS_EXTERNAL_FRONT_KEY=my-secret-here
npm run dev
```

Leave Astro running in this terminal.

### The `starter-kit-astro` project

[starter-kit-astro](https://github.com/apostrophecms/starter-kit-astro) is an example of how
ApostropheCMS can be configured to provide content to Astro.

In a separate terminal, clone your Apostrophe project and configure
environment variables:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apostrophecms/starter-kit-astro
cd starter-kit-astro
npm install
export APOS_EXTERNAL_FRONT_KEY=my-secret-here
export APOS_MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@get-this-from-atlas
```

Next, create an admin user for Apostrophe:

```bash
# Do this just once, to add an admin user so you can log in
node app @apostrophecms/user:add admin admin
```

Now, start Apostrophe and leave it running in the terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Logging in to edit the site

Now we are ready to log in. Log in directly to your Astro project, not your ApostropheCMS project, at:

```
http://localhost:4321/login
```

Log in with the credentials you set when you added the admin user above.

### How to edit the content

Click "Edit" to start editing the page. Notice that you can add content directly on
the page and change your previous content. You can also edit content via the admin
bar at the top.

To make your settings visible when logged out (to "the public" once a site is deployed),
click the "Update" button. Until then you can keep revising your draft changes, which
save automatically.

### Next steps with the Astro integration for ApostropheCMS

Apostrophe can do a lot more than just basic page editing. You can create your own custom widget types,
as well as custom content types like articles and products. For a complete guide, check out the
[Astro integration for ApostropheCMS](https://apostrophecms.com/extensions/astro-integration)
documentation, as well as the [ApostropheCMS developer documentation](https://v3.docs.apostrophecms.org/).
