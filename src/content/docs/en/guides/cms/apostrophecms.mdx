[ApostropheCMS](https://apostrophecms.com) is an open-source JavaScript and NodeJS CMS that
supports editing right on the page while rendering content with Astro.

Apostrophe provides on-page editing, while Astro provides the most modern development experience.
Linking the two together provides both, with just one set of templates written in Astro.

## Getting started

### The `astro-frontend` project

Check out our [astro-frontend](https://github.com/apostrophecms/astro-frontend) project for an
example of an Astro project that is already set up to use ApostropheCMS as its content source.
You'll need to set the `APOS_EXTERNAL_FRONT_KEY` environment variable to a secret of your own,
and set that same variable when running `starter-kit-astro`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apostrophecms/astro-frontend
cd astro-frontend
npm install
export APOS_EXTERNAL_FRONT_KEY=my-secret-here
npm run dev
```

But don't visit that home page quite yet; we need to start up Apostrophe too.

### The `starter-kit-astro` project

Next, check out our [starter-kit-astro](https://github.com/apostrophecms/starter-kit-astro) project to see
how ApostropheCMS can be configured to provide content to Astro. Make sure you set
`APOS_EXTERNAL_FRONT_KEY` to the same value in both projects so they can communicate.

> Since it is oriented toward editing "on the fly," Apostrophe is backed by a database, not git.
> So you will need [MongoDB on your computer](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/),
> or a [MongoDB Atlas database](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=search_gs_pl_evergreen_atlas_core-high-int_prosp-brand_gic-null_amers-us_ps-all_desktop_eng_lead&utm_term=mongo%20atlas%20free%20tier&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=19609124046&adgroup=145188748043&cq_cmp=19609124046&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAs6-sBhBmEiwA1Nl8s1mNY6W2UqlY7GkWVr8GEc0ThfZlJvfGOkLpcFuC-TWXP3QowWM-DhoCF9YQAvD_BwE) (yes, the free tier works). If you're using
> Atlas, be sure to set the APOS_MONGODB_URI environment variable to the connection string
> provided by Atlas, with the database password included.

In a separate terminal, let's start up Apostrophe:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apostrophecms/starter-kit-astro
cd starter-kit-astro
npm install
export APOS_EXTERNAL_FRONT_KEY=my-secret-here
# Do this just once, to add an admin user so you can log in
node app @apostrophecms/user:add admin admin
npm run dev
```

### Logging in: log into Astro, not Apostrophe

One more step: logging in! **Don't** go to Apostrophe's login prompt; instead,
go straight to Astro at:

```
http://localhost:4321/login
```

Log in with the credentials you set when you added the admin user, above.

### Make your first content edits

Click "Edit" to start editing the page. Notice that you can add content directly on
the page and change your previous content. You can also edit content via the admin
bar at the top.

### Next steps with the Astro integration for ApostropheCMS

Apostrophe can do a lot more than just basic page editing. You can create your own custom widget types,
as well as custom content types like articles and products. For a complete guide, check out the
[Astro integration for ApostropheCMS](https://apostrophecms.com/extensions/astro-integration)
documentation, as well as the [ApostropheCMS developer documentation](https://v3.docs.apostrophecms.org/).
